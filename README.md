The Palazzo Bella Vista Restaurant mini project is a simple yet interactive website designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is structured into four main sections:

Home Section: A welcoming page that introduces visitors to the restaurant.

About Section: Provides detailed information about Palazoo Bella Vista, its ambiance, and unique dining experience.

Menu Section: Showcases a list of delicious food items available at the restaurant.

Contact Section: Contains a form where users can easily reach out to the restaurant for inquiries or reservations.

The navigation bar allows smooth switching between different sections. When users click on Home, About, Menu, or Contact, they are taken directly to that part of the page, enhancing user experience.

This project demonstrates the use of HTML for structure, CSS for styling and design, and JavaScript for interactivity and smooth navigation. Itâ€™s a beginner-friendly web development project that highlights the integration of multiple technologies to create a functional restaurant website.
